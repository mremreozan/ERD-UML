Conversion rules
	Use the entity type rule to convert each entity type
	Use the 1-M relationship rule for all relationships
	Use the identification dependency rule to make DateSent a component of the PK of DisburseLine. 
		The PK of the DisburseLine table is a combination of Datasent and LoanNo.
	Not null constraints are needed for the primary key of Entities.
	A not null constraint is not needed for “DisburseLine.LoanNo” 
		because this column is already part of the primary key of DisburseLine.
