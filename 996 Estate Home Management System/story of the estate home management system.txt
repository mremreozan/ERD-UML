The Estate Home Management System

	The database should track homes and owners. 
	A home is either owner occupied or rented.  
	An owner can possess one or more homes.  
	Each home has only one owner.	
2.	Refine the ERD from problem 1 by adding an agent entity type.  
	Agents represent owners in the sale of a home. 
	An agent can list many homes, but only one agent can list a home.  
	When an owner agrees to list a home with an agent, 
	a commission (percentage of the sales price) and a selling price are determined.
3.	In the ERD from problem 2, transform the attribute, office identifier, into an entity type. 
4.	In the ERD from problem 3, add a buyer entity type  An agent can work with many buyers,
	but a buyer works with only one agent. 
5.	Revise the ERD from problem 5 by adding an offer entity type.  
	A buyer makes an offer on a home for a specified sales price. 
	The offer starts on the submission date and time and expires on the specified date and time. 
	A unique offer number identifies an offer. A buyer can submit multiple offers for the same home.
